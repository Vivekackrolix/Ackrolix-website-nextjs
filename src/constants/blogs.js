          <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Improve Time to Value</h2>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Time to value is the time it takes for a user to gain value from a
            piece of content. And your content's time to value should be short.
            Short time to value lets your users get what they're looking for as
            quickly as possible. But with hero images, author bios, and
            long-winded intros, many websites have poor time to value.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Poor time to value can negatively affect your bounce rate, dwell
            time, and average session duration. And this could affect your
            traffic and rankings. So, how do you improve time to value? By
            putting the most important information and elements at the top of
            the page. Ideally, above the fold.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Use the bottom line up front (BLUF) approach—also called the
            inverted pyramid approach. In other words, put the information users
            are looking for at the top. Keep your introductions short and get to
            the point. Don't waste anyone's time.
          </p>

          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            For example: Investopedia's articles do a great job with time to
            value. In the image below, you can see they hit on a definition of
            the term in the image. And then provide a summary of the article in
            the "Key Takeaways" section. Right at the top. Users can get exactly
            what they're looking for immediately—without really having to
            scroll.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            Surprise: It's no surprise that pages from such websites
            consistently rank in the top few positions for relevant keywords on
            Google.

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Understanding Topic Clusters</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Topic clusters are an interconnected framework of content that encapsulates a primary subject, enhancing the site's topical relevance and authority. This strategy ensures readers can find a wealth of information on your site, fulfilling their initial inquiry and any subsequent questions they may have.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">This interconnected content framework can significantly bolster a website's SEO by organizing content more coherently and improving the user experience.</p>

    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">Benefits of Topic Clusters</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
      <li class="text-gray-700"><strong>Enhanced Navigation and User Experience:</strong> By grouping related content, users can easily find and navigate related materials, improving their overall site engagement.</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700"><strong>Improved Search Engine Recognition:</strong> Search engines can better understand the hierarchy and breadth of your site's content, potentially increasing your visibility in search results.</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700"><strong>Topical Authority:</strong> By thoroughly covering a topic, your site can be seen as an authoritative source, which may lead to better rankings for associated keywords and phrases.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-gray-700">For instance: HubSpot has a topic cluster on content marketing, which is their pillar page. And they have several subtopics, such as content marketing strategy, content marketing examples, and content marketing metrics, which are their cluster pages. They all link to and from the pillar page, creating a topic cluster.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Surprise: HubSpot ranks for thousands of keywords related to content marketing, thanks to their topic cluster strategy.</p>
  </div>

<div class="mt-5">
  <div>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Optimize for Featured Snippets</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Featured snippets are the boxes that appear at the top of the search results, providing a quick answer to a user's query. They are also known as "position zero" because they rank above the first organic result. Featured snippets can help you increase your visibility, traffic, and authority on Google.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">To optimize for featured snippets, you need to understand the types of queries and content that trigger them. According to Semrush, there are three main types of featured snippets: paragraphs, lists, and tables. And they are triggered by different types of queries, such as definitions, how-tos, comparisons, and more.</p>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">To optimize for featured snippets, you need to:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
      <li class="text-gray-700">Identify the keywords and topics that have featured snippet opportunities. You can use tools like Semrush's Featured Snippet Tool to find them.</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Create content that answers the query in a clear and concise way. Use headings, bullet points, tables, and other formatting elements to structure your content. Include the query or a variation of it in your content.</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Add schema markup to your content to help Google understand and display it better. Schema markup is a code that you can add to your HTML to provide additional information to search engines. You can use tools like Google's Structured Data Markup Helper to generate schema markup for your content.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-gray-700">For example: If you search for "how to make french toast", you will see a featured snippet with a list of ingredients and steps from Allrecipes. This is because they have optimized their content for the query, using headings, bullet points, and schema markup.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Surprise: Allrecipes gets a lot of traffic and exposure from this featured snippet, as well as other ones they have earned.</p>
  </div>
</div>



<div class="mt-5">
  <div>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Use Schema Markup for Rich Results</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Rich results are the enhanced search results that display additional information, such as images, ratings, prices, or availability. They are also known as rich snippets or rich cards. Rich results can help you stand out from the crowd, attract more clicks, and increase conversions.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">To get rich results, you need to use schema markup on your content. Schema markup is a code that you can add to your HTML to provide additional information to search engines. Schema markup can help you get rich results for different types of content, such as:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
      <li class="text-gray-700">Products</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Reviews</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Recipes</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Events</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">FAQs</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">How-tos</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Articles</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Videos</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-gray-700">You can use tools like Google's Structured Data Markup Helper or Semrush's Schema Markup Generator to generate schema markup for your content. You can also use Google's Rich Results Test to check if your content is eligible for rich results.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700">For example: If you search for "best wireless headphones", you will see rich results with images, ratings, and prices from TechRadar. This is because they have used schema markup on their product review content.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Surprise: TechRadar gets more attention and clicks from these rich results, as well as other ones they have earned.</p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="mt-5">
  <div>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Optimize for Voice Search</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Voice search is the process of using voice commands to search for information on the internet. It's becoming increasingly popular, especially with the rise of smart speakers and voice assistants like Google Assistant, Amazon Alexa, and Apple Siri. According to Semrush, voice search accounts for 20% of all mobile searches and 25% of all searches on Windows 10 devices.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">To optimize for voice search, you need to understand its differences from text search. Voice search queries are typically longer, more conversational, and question-based. Users seek quick and accurate answers rather than sifting through multiple results.</p>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">To optimize for voice search, consider the following:</h3>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
      <li class="text-gray-700">Use natural language and long-tail keywords. Utilize tools like Semrush's ‘Keyword Magic Tool’ or ‘Answer the Public’ to find voice search keywords and questions relevant to your topic.</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Optimize for featured snippets and rich results, which are often the source of voice search answers. Employ schema markup and the ‘BLUF’ approach (Bottom Line Up Front) to create content that triggers featured snippets and rich results.</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Optimize for local SEO since voice search users frequently seek local information such as directions, opening hours, or reviews. Manage your local listings and citations using tools like Semrush's ‘Listing Management Tool’ or ‘Google My Business (GMB)’.</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Optimize for mobile SEO, as voice search users commonly use mobile devices. Check and improve your site's mobile-friendliness using tools like Semrush's ‘Site Audit Tool’ or Google's ‘Mobile-Friendly Test’.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="text-gray-700">For example, if you ask Google Assistant "how to make french toast," you'll receive a voice answer sourced from the featured snippet seen earlier from Allrecipes. This is because they've optimized their content for voice search by using natural language, bullet points, and schema markup.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Surprise: Allrecipes garners more traffic and exposure from this voice search answer, as well as other earned ones.</p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="mt-5">
  <div >
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Optimize for Core Web Vitals</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Core Web Vitals are a set of metrics that measure the user experience of a web page, including loading speed, interactivity, and visual stability. They are part of Google's ‘Page Experience’ signals, which also include mobile-friendliness, HTTPS, safe browsing, and intrusive interstitials.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Optimizing ‘Core Web Vitals’ is crucial for improving user satisfaction and engagement, as they are important ranking factors for Google.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">To optimize for Core Web Vitals, you need to focus on improving three key metrics:</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 mb-4">
      <li class="text-gray-700">Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): This measures how long it takes for the largest content element on a page to load.
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
          <li>Reduce server response times.</li>
          <li>Optimize and compress images.</li>
          <li>Implement lazy loading.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): This measures how much a page’s layout shifts unexpectedly as it loads.
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
          <li>Provide proper dimensions for images and embeds.</li>
          <li>Limit the number of HTTP requests.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">First Input Delay (FID): This measures how long it takes for the browser to respond to a user’s first interaction with a page.
        <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
          <li>Reduce Javascript execution.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Implementing a caching solution can also help improve your Core Web Vitals. These optimizations not only enhance your website's performance but also improve the overall user experience.</p>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="mt-5">
  <div>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Optimize for Semantic Search</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Semantic search focuses on understanding the intent and context of user queries, rather than just matching keywords. To optimize for semantic search:</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 mb-4">
      <li class="text-gray-700">Use natural language and long-tail keywords in your content.</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Create comprehensive content that answers user queries clearly.</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Add structured data using schema markup.</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Utilize natural language processing tools to analyze and optimize content.</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Optimize entities related to your content.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Example: If you search for "who is the president of the United States", Google provides a knowledge panel with relevant information, demonstrating semantic search in action.</p>
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Optimize for Video Search</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Video search involves using video content to rank on search engines. To optimize for video search:</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 mb-4">
      <li class="text-gray-700">Perform keyword research to find relevant topics.</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Create engaging video content that addresses user queries.</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Optimize video title, description, tags, and thumbnails.</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Promote videos on social media and other platforms.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Example: Tasty ranks first on YouTube for "how to make french toast" due to effective video optimization and promotion.</p>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="mt-5">
  <div >
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Optimize for E-A-T</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">E-A-T stands for Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. It is a concept that Google uses to evaluate the quality and credibility of a website and its content. E-A-T is especially important for websites that fall under the category of Your Money or Your Life (YMYL), which are websites that can affect the user's health, happiness, safety, or financial stability. E-A-T is also a ranking factor for Google, as it affects the user's satisfaction and confidence.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">To optimize for E-A-T, you need to demonstrate your expertise, authority, and trustworthiness on your website and your content. You also need to get positive reviews, ratings, and feedback from your customers and users. And you need to avoid any negative signals, such as spam, malware, or low-quality content.</p>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">To optimize for E-A-T, you need to:</h3>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 mb-4">
      <li class="text-gray-700">Create high-quality and relevant content that provides value to your audience. Use your knowledge, skills, and experience to create content that answers the user's query in a clear and comprehensive way. Use credible sources, data, and facts to support your claims and arguments. Update your content regularly to keep it fresh and accurate.</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Display your credentials and qualifications on your website and your content. Use your real name, photo, and bio to show who you are and what you do. Include your education, certifications, awards, and achievements to show your expertise and authority. Link to your social media profiles, portfolio, or other websites to show your online presence and reputation.</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Build your online reputation and authority by getting positive reviews, ratings, and feedback from your customers and users. Encourage your customers to leave reviews on platforms like Google My Business, Trustpilot, or Yelp. Respond to your reviews, both positive and negative, in a polite and professional way. Showcase your testimonials, case studies, and success stories on your website and your content.</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Avoid any negative signals that can harm your E-A-T, such as spam, malware, or low-quality content. Use tools like Semrush's Site Audit Tool or Google's Search Console to check and fix any issues on your website, such as broken links, duplicate content, or security errors. Follow Google's Webmaster Guidelines and Quality Rater Guidelines to ensure your website and content meet Google's standards and expectations.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="text-gray-700">For example: If you search for "best wireless headphones", you will see a result from Wirecutter, which is a website that provides expert reviews and recommendations for various products. This is because they have optimized their website and content for E-A-T, using their expertise, authority, and trustworthiness to provide high-quality and relevant content.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700">For instance: Wirecutter</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Wirecutter ranks high on Google for the query "best wireless headphones", thanks to their E-A-T optimization.</p>
  </div>

<div class="mt-5">
  <div >
    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Optimize for Mobile Search</h2>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">Mobile search is the process of using mobile devices, such as smartphones or tablets, to search for information on the internet. Mobile search is becoming more dominant, as users are using more mobile devices to access the internet, especially on the go. According to Semrush, mobile devices account for 55% of all web traffic and 61% of all Google searches.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">To optimize for mobile search, you need to create a mobile-friendly and responsive website that provides a fast and smooth user experience on any device.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">You also need to optimize your content, design, and features for mobile users, who have different needs and behaviors than desktop users. And you need to use mobile SEO best practices, such as AMP, PWA, and app indexing, to improve your visibility and performance on mobile search.</p>
    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold mb-2">To optimize for mobile search, you need to:</h3>
    <ol class="list-decimal ml-6 mb-4">
      <li class="text-gray-700">Create a mobile-friendly and responsive website that adapts to any screen size and orientation. Use tools like Semrush’s Site Audit Tool or Google’s Mobile-Friendly Test to check and improve your site’s mobile-friendliness. Fix any issues, such as slow loading speed, poor layout, or broken links, that can affect your mobile user experience.</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Optimize your content, design, and features for mobile users, who have different needs and behaviors than desktop users. For example: Use shorter paragraphs, bullet points, and headings to make your content easier to read and scan. Use clear and concise language to convey your message and value proposition. Use images, videos, and other visuals to enhance your content and appeal to your audience. Use buttons, menus, and forms that are easy to tap and fill out. Use voice search, geolocation, and personalization to provide relevant and customized information and solutions.</li>
      <li class="text-gray-700">Use mobile SEO best practices, such as AMP, PWA, and app indexing, to improve your visibility and performance on mobile search. For example: AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) are web pages that load faster and use less data on mobile devices. PWA (Progressive Web Apps) are web applications that provide app-like features and functionality on mobile devices. App indexing is the process of making your app content searchable and accessible on Google. You can use tools like Google’s AMP Test, Google’s Lighthouse, and Google’s Firebase App Indexing to implement and optimize these mobile SEO techniques.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="text-gray-700">For example: If you search for “best wireless headphones” on your mobile device, you will see a result from CNET that uses AMP, PWA, and app indexing. This is because they have optimized their website and content for mobile search, using mobile-friendly design, fast loading speed, and app-like features.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700">Example: CNET</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700">CNET ranks high on mobile search for the query “best wireless headphones”, thanks to their mobile optimization.</p>
